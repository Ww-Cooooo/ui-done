# React Application Stack

Read this reference whenever a React product has, or may need, theme modes, routing and URL state, requests/server state, shared client state, or forms. React is the fixed framework contract. The goal is one coherent owner per concern, not a maximal package list.

This is a time-bounded discovery snapshot. Before installing or recommending a package, use `$web-access` to verify the current official documentation, package metadata, maintenance, license, React compatibility, accessibility, delivery behavior, and migration guidance. Last verified: 2026-09-02.

## React-only boundary

- Use React for new application code. Prefer TypeScript for a greenfield substantial application, but preserve a sound existing React language/build choice unless changing it has a concrete benefit.
- For a new browser-rendered client application, React with Vite is the default starting point unless the delivery requires another approved React runtime.
- Preserve an existing sound React router, query layer, state owner, form owner, and theme system when they fit. Replacing an owner is a migration, not routine cleanup.
- If the input is not React, define one clean React migration boundary. Do not add Vue code, recommend Vue packages, or leave two UI frameworks owning the same product.
- These concerns are conditional. A static single-surface interface may legitimately use no router, no remote-data cache, no global store, and no form library.

## Required UI system and default devices

- Every delivered React interface uses one primary React UI component system. For greenfield or ownerless work, use Ant Design. Preserve another established React system only when it already owns the product or Ant Design fails a documented delivery, accessibility, license, brand, or runtime gate.
- Use Ant Design components instead of rebuilding ordinary buttons, inputs, selects, dialogs, drawers, menus, tabs, tables, pagination, feedback, and form structure from scratch. Extend Ant Design tokens and compose its components before adding a second primitive or component system.
- Use Ant Design design tokens/`ConfigProvider` for component theming, Ant Design Form for ordinary product forms, and Ant Design Grid/Flex/Layout plus project CSS for responsive structure.
- Use `@ant-design/icons` as the default family for ordinary interface symbols when Ant Design owns the UI. Official brand marks, illustrations, photography, and domain-specific assets remain separate provenance decisions.
- Default responsive acceptance covers one representative computer viewport, one tablet viewport, and one phone viewport. Add extra-wide, extra-narrow, landscape-specific, TV, kiosk, embedded, or other unusual targets only when the user or explicit delivery contract names them.

## Current React candidate matrix

| Concern | Start with | Escalate when | React candidates and boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Theme modes | Ant Design `ConfigProvider` and design tokens, synchronized with semantic CSS custom properties and platform color-scheme behavior | The product genuinely supports system/light/dark or branded modes, user choice must persist, or component tokens must synchronize | Keep Ant Design as the default component-token owner. Use another established system's provider only when that system already owns the project. Do not add a theme switch merely to display a second palette. |
| Routing and URL state | The curated source library has no owner: use no router for a true single-surface artifact; otherwise keep the existing React router | The product has distinct routes, deep links, browser history, nested layouts, loaders, or shareable filter/search state | React Router is the broad established route owner. TanStack Router is a serious option when strongly typed routes/search params and integrated loader conventions justify its extra structure. Record `curated-catalog gap`; never run two routers. |
| Requests and server state | The curated source library has no owner: keep the existing React request layer or use `fetch` for a small isolated flow | Data is shared, cached, invalidated, refreshed, paginated, optimistically updated, or synchronized across screens | TanStack Query can own React server-state caching and synchronization. RTK Query is coherent when Redux Toolkit already owns application state. Record `curated-catalog gap`; do not mirror query results into a second global store. |
| Client state | The curated source library has no owner: keep the existing React owner or use component state/reducer/context for modest state | Independent features need shared writable client state, devtools, middleware, normalized entities, or predictable event history | Zustand is a compact option; Redux Toolkit is the structured option for complex domain state or an existing Redux product. Record `curated-catalog gap` and keep URL, server, and form state in their own owners. |
| Forms | Ant Design Form and Ant Design controls | Dynamic arrays, complex schema validation, reusable form composition, async checks, or rendering cost makes a separate headless owner worthwhile | React Hook Form or TanStack Form may own complex form state while Ant Design remains the component/visual owner. Do not replace Ant Design controls with ad hoc fields. |

## Theme-mode contract

1. Define semantic surface, text, border, accent, state, focus, chart, and elevation tokens rather than swapping raw colors component by component.
2. Declare compatible browser chrome/form-control schemes with `color-scheme`; use `prefers-color-scheme` when the product follows the operating-system preference.
3. If a manual mode is a real product requirement, define precedence among user choice, system preference, and product default; persist only the mode identifier, not personal data.
4. Synchronize Canvas, charts, code highlighting, images, scrollbars, native controls, and the primary React component system with the same mode owner.
5. Verify every supported mode in the viewport/state matrix. Do not claim a mode exists when only the page background changes.

## Routing and state ownership rules

- Put bookmarkable/shareable filters, tabs, pagination, and selections in URL state when that behavior is part of the product contract.
- Keep remote records and request status in the request/query owner. Keep ephemeral UI state near the component that owns it.
- Promote state to a global store only after naming two or more real consumers or a cross-route workflow that local composition cannot serve cleanly.
- Make route, request, global-state, and form owners explicit in the handoff so future work does not add a duplicate layer.

## Request and form behavior

- Every request path needs honest loading, empty, success, validation, timeout/error, retry, permission, and offline behavior where applicable.
- Cancel or ignore obsolete work when navigation, filters, or inputs make an earlier response stale. Do not allow late responses to overwrite newer intent.
- Keep form labels, instructions, errors, required state, disabled/submitting state, focus movement, and server errors understandable without relying on color or animation.
- Do not let a form library replace semantic HTML or let a component library hide the form owner's validation state.

## Adoption record

For each applicable concern, record: current owner, selected owner, reason, official evidence and date, package/version, license, migration boundary, distribution/offline effect, runtime failure behavior, and the rejected duplicate. For a non-applicable concern, record that fact in one line and move on.
