# Page Composition and Integrated Experience

Use this guide for a new page or material redesign, or when a review finds fragmented content, poor task-space allocation, or enhancements that are technically present but do not improve the experience. It works without the development conversation or the private projects that exposed these problems. Isolated copy/color repairs do not need a new composition exercise.

`../SKILL.md` owns required capabilities and exemptions. This guide explains how to compose them into a page; it does not make React, the primary UI system, typography, GSAP, or other default categories optional. `visual-qa.md` owns verification scope. The examples below illustrate decisions, not fixed templates, required dimensions, or new features to add to every product.

## Start from a task and its relationships

A page skeleton is the arrangement of content, navigation, controls, and working space, including how that arrangement changes during use. It is not a loading placeholder or an application framework. Begin with the user's actual content, not a menu of hero, statistics, cards, chart, and form components.

Resolve these questions in the existing design read; no separate document is required:

- What is the user primarily reading, comparing, deciding, or changing? A report, a selected order, a photograph, and a story need different amounts and kinds of space.
- Which information belongs to that same object? Which items must be compared simultaneously, share a time/space coordinate, or remain visible during an action?
- What is the useful sequence? For example, find a record, inspect its evidence, change its status, and continue from the same position. Do not add steps to make the page look substantial.
- Which context may recede? Global navigation and occasional settings need not compete with the work. Do not hide evidence or controls needed at the current step just to obtain a clean screenshot.
- Which real modes change these answers? Audio versus video, reading versus editing, and overview versus close comparison may need different allocations while retaining selection, drafts, and familiar control meanings.

For example: “A reviewer selects a spoken line, sees the matching video frame and time range, writes a note, then continues at that position.” This determines coordination between regions. “A dashboard with five stylish panels” specifies containers but explains none of those relationships.

## Choose a structure that expresses those relationships

Consider structures by what they let the user do. These are alternatives to reason about, not a required set, a layout picker, or six reusable page shells:

| Content relationship | Useful structural direction | What must stay coherent | Common misuse |
|---|---|---|---|
| One object with several tools | A continuous working surface with nearby controls and contextual inspection | Selection, object visibility, and tool feedback | Making player, settings, annotations, and status equally prominent cards |
| Many records, one active record | A list/table with in-place detail or a dedicated detail view when space requires it | Active record, filters, scroll position, and a clear return path | A permanent three-column shell regardless of content or available width |
| A genuine comparison | Aligned rows, shared axes, synchronized views, or a justified before/after treatment | Matching fields, units, time, and object identity | Separate attractive cards that require remembering values or compare unrelated assets |
| Time, geography, or spatial relationships | A timeline, calendar, map, or canvas as the working surface | One coordinate system and a clear connection to selected details | Hiding the relationship inside summary cards and treating the real view as decoration |
| A developing argument or story | Continuous editorial reading, steps, or a persistent visual that changes with the explanation | Reading order, state continuity, and understandable backward navigation | Making each sentence a new block, or pinning the entire page because a demo did so |
| Independent items to browse | Cards, tiles, a catalog, or a real Kanban board | Item identity, comparable metadata, and meaningful grouping | Treating every fact about one item as a separate independent item |

Keep useful consistency within a product: the same action should retain its meaning, and navigation should not move merely to appear novel. The stricter distinctness rules in `SKILL.md` apply when a collection is explicitly meant to demonstrate different designs. They do not require every screen of an ordinary application to invent a new navigation system.

## Develop visual character, not just a clean wireframe

After choosing the content relationships, design their visible expression before application code. Keep this inside the representative drafts, not in a separate brand dossier:

- **A recognizable subject:** use the real object, content rhythm or task as the visual center. A book catalog can derive rhythm from spines and title proportions; an analysis tool can derive it from an aligned comparison. Neither needs a decorative mascot or invented statistics.
- **Typographic contrast:** choose actual body/display/data roles and show real text at their intended scales. Establish a decisive difference between the focal reading and secondary metadata; “two nice fonts” without readable hierarchy is not a direction. Keep the open-source font/specimen requirements.
- **Surface and color relationships:** decide where contrast concentrates, how background and foreground separate, and how edges, depth or texture support the subject. Quiet surrounding chrome can make a rich central surface legible. “Avoid generic gradients” is not a ban on color, illustration or material; a pale empty screen is not automatically refined.
- **Control craft:** align icon optical size, label baseline, padding, radius, edge and focus treatment as a family within this product. Give the primary action a clear weight without making every button a glossy attraction. Plan the related [control response](motion-scroll-and-3d.md#buttons-and-control-feedback), not only its resting screenshot.
- **Character through use:** carry the chosen type, alignment, material and subject relationship into the ordinary action state. A distinctive opening that becomes a default form after one click has not delivered the whole direction.

Give each candidate a short explanation of its specific design decisions, not a style nickname alone. Compare them with the same representative content and at the same viewing scale. Ask what is recognizable without the app name, how attention moves, and whether the main task remains obvious. Do not remove the subject imagery when that imagery is itself the content; the diagnostic is whether the interface has been designed around it rather than relying on it to disguise a stock shell. Refine a strong direction before implementation instead of polishing several weak coded applications.

## Group without turning everything into a card

The “sticky notes on a wall” failure occurs when each function gets its own background, title, padding, rounded outline, and similar visual weight. The page may be tidy, but the user cannot tell what matters or which pieces belong together. This describes the rendered composition, not a component name: several large custom `div` panels can reproduce the same problem without using a single `Card`. React componentization and Ant Design use do not require this visual fragmentation; reuse their controls without automatically enclosing each function.

Start with alignment, proximity, typographic hierarchy, common background, and a shared coordinate system. Add a boundary when it communicates independent identity, a distinct action context, a necessary scroll region, or meaningful contrast. A task card on a Kanban board has an independent identity; the playback button, timecode, and volume control for one player usually belong to one control group.

Neither removing every border nor giving each box a different shape fixes a weak hierarchy. A card-based catalog can be excellent, and an unboxed page can still be an undifferentiated wall. Ask whether the main task is perceptibly dominant and related information is read together, not whether the card count is below an arbitrary limit.

Use visual contrast intentionally: one working area can be broad and dense while secondary metadata is compact. Do not enlarge empty space or a decorative heading at the expense of readable task content. Rich illustration, expressive typography, and atmosphere remain valid when they express the actual subject rather than competing with it.

## Repair a rejected layout family

Use this method when the user rejects a structure or overall direction, not as a new ceremony for routine edits. Name the rejected visible relationship from actual feedback—for example, “three equal full-height islands, with an always-visible form competing with the reviewed object.” Ambiguous “professional” or “AI-generated” feedback routes to [clarification](feedback-clarification.md) only when available evidence cannot distinguish the needed revision.

An authorized full overhaul starts from actual content and the confirmed brief, not the previous component tree. Preserve data, permissions, accurate coordinates, persistence, and expressly retained functions; layout, scale, grouping, visual language, and interaction presentation may change. Familiarity or a smaller diff does not justify keeping the old composition. A targeted correction still stays inside its scope.

Form a positive whole-design proposal before assigning tool slots. Describe the dominant content, secondary relationships, actual typographic scale/placement, surface/material/contrast treatment, and the change through one meaningful action. Show those together in a small rendered sample with representative content, not a list of adjectives or a monochrome outline as the final design. Consider a genuinely different concept if the first is ordinary; merely avoiding cards/columns proves no visual identity.

Use a simple outline to catch recurrence of the rejected topology, then judge the styled first impression and ordinary action state. A clean cover that opens the old card wall on first use is not a structural repair. Neither a lower card count nor a borderless/full-screen stage establishes a better concept. Preserve readable task content; arbitrary empty space or huge decoration can be a different failure. Identify which concrete decisions give the design its character and how those decisions develop during the main action. For example, a large timecode may establish an expressive opening, but deleting it when an ordinary note opens can leave an unrelated stock player-and-form view. The timecode need not stay huge or in the same place: it could change scale or join the selected frame and note target through a visible, coherent transition. Test whether that proposed relationship actually improves this task and preserves the intended character; do not prescribe a giant clock or this arrangement for other products.

Follow the default design-first sequence in `../SKILL.md`: before implementing a new page or substantial redesign, compare several styled candidates on the same representative content, refine the selected direction, and obtain the user's design confirmation. Give each candidate a genuinely different whole composition or visual identity, not the same layout in different colors and not a deliberately weak alternative. Show actual content hierarchy, proportions, typography, surface treatment, and the ordinary action state together; use a transition storyboard or labeled previsualization when motion is important. A monochrome outline is not the finished design, and a static storyboard communicates intended motion rather than runtime feel. A confirmed existing design need not be redrawn, and scoped repairs do not restart this process. Do not build a coded application or its APIs, media processing, persistence, or full feature set merely to present the alternatives. After confirmation, implement the complete agreed scope and inspect the relevant real sequence and continuation. Required UI, fonts, motion, Canvas, scrolling, and truthful visualization govern that implementation; mark planned or incomplete integration honestly rather than claiming a static draft proves it or inventing an exemption.

Use [concrete reference evidence](open-source-ui-sources.md#preserve-concrete-reference-evidence) to design a recognizable adaptation, not to impose its scenery or only assert a principle. Whole-experience evidence should settle a specific spatial/behavioral question; isolated button/API demos cannot settle that question. No new site quota or full re-research is needed when the relevant evidence already exists.

Finally ask whether the proposal itself meets the intended impression, subject, content density, and operation—not only whether each correction is present. Functional synchronization, a working save, or reference-trait resemblance are separate evidence. When the whole concept still fails, change the concept before polishing or expanding it. Do not make “all requested details present” the stopping condition.

**Counterexample.** Moving an occasional opinion form out of a permanent column can solve fragmentation, but a deep bottom timeline can still shrink portrait footage into an unreadable strip. A more dramatic opening image can hide that same bad editing state. Inspect actual media/text proportions and the open action state at the same viewport; preserve selection, evidence, time range, and continuation without prescribing one universal panel arrangement. A persistent inspector remains valid when simultaneous comparison really requires it; cards remain valid for independent items.

## Distinct works, not theme variants

Apply this only to a gallery, concept set, or collection explicitly meant to demonstrate different designs. A normal product may use consistent navigation and interaction. Separate the collection shell (search, filters, neutral metadata/navigation) from each work's internal composition, media rhythm, content topology, action locus, scroll progression, motion grammar, and ending. A preview must represent its actual work, not a separately polished poster.

Before implementing such a set, keep a compact route comparison in the existing design note: product/user/task, opening and dominant masses, detail/overlay carrier, primary action or reading progression, main transition, ending, and authentic content source. Include phone/tablet transformation only if those targets are required. Compare pairs: a repeated skeleton + detail carrier + scroll + primary-motion combination needs a genuine shared task/content reason; palettes, fonts, images, and renamed geometry do not supply one. Do not default every work to the same Drawer, Modal, three-column editor, hero-to-sections sequence, or reveal preset.

When the user explicitly requires zero visible reuse, follow that stricter boundary: compare textless outlines of the opening and main action states. Each work must own its visible navigation/return placement, dominant masses/axis, metadata, controls/progress, detail carrier, media proportions, page edge, scrolling, and main choreography. Two works that fit the same wireframe fail that contract. Keep the mandatory Ant Design primitives, but compose/style them into different structures; invisible React lifecycle, data access, fallback, and build infrastructure can remain shared. Do not apply this exceptional novelty rule to ordinary related product screens.

For broad product showcases, let genuine tasks yield different architectures—analysis, monitoring, planning, review, operations, or expressive exploration where authorized. Do not turn every subject into a poster/landing page, add routes merely to fill a taxonomy, or distort a useful product for novelty. Extract shared visible components only after related needs are proven, not before designing the works.

## Allocate usable space across modes

Judge the displayed object, not just its outer container. A tall video fitted inside a wide, shallow player will remain narrow even when the surrounding panel is huge. With contain-style fitting, displayed width is limited by both container width and container height multiplied by the media aspect ratio. Extra horizontal space alone cannot solve insufficient height; cropping is not a fix when review requires seeing the complete frame.

For a bounded workspace, consider headers, controls, the main object, supporting regions, and the available viewport together. Enlarging one row consumes another row's budget. Choose proportions and minimum usable sizes from representative content and the actual task, not a universal pixel constant or a fixed “two-thirds main” rule. A minimum CSS height proves an allocation exists, not that subtitles, fine detail, labels, or editing controls are usable.

When content or mode changes, reclaim space that no longer serves the task. An audio-only mode may prioritize waveform, transcript, and notes instead of retaining a video-sized panel for a slogan. A portrait-video mode may move or reshape supporting regions to preserve frame detail. Keep primary actions available, preserve state during the change, and make the mode understandable. Do not automatically implement a new mode if the product does not need one.

Resizable panels and contextual disclosure can help, but the initial layout must already work. Do not require the user to discover a splitter before the primary task becomes possible. On a smaller screen, use an explicit focus/detail transition when simultaneous views cease to work; stacking every desktop region is not the only option. Avoid hiding necessary comparison information behind tabs just to fit more regions.

## Integrate capabilities without token adoption

Keep these answers in the existing inclusion plan, not in a second report:

1. **Host:** Which existing product object, content, dataset, state, interaction, or established visual motif owns the enhancement?
2. **Meaning:** What will the user understand, accomplish, notice, or feel because it is present? “More premium” is not specific; “the selected line and its time range remain visibly linked while the reviewer seeks” is.
3. **Control:** Does direct manipulation serve a real task or accessibility need? Do not expose reset, speed, rotate, pause, or view controls merely because a demo has them.
4. **Observable result:** In which ordinary state or action will that contribution be apparent? Define the result in product terms rather than import count, library names, or animation duration.

Choose a footprint that retains that result:

- **Structural:** powers an existing workflow or real data view, such as a chart that exposes a meaningful comparison.
- **Behavioral:** improves a transition, feedback loop, navigation path, or scroll path without adding content.
- **Accent:** gives an existing region a subject-specific visual character without inventing meaning or stealing task space. For example, a restrained material texture may reinforce an established print/publication direction; unexplained particles added to a review player only to host Canvas do not establish the same fit.
- **Infrastructure:** improves loading, rendering, packaging, measurement, or maintenance without needing a visible demonstration. State the actual gain or diagnostic purpose; invisibility alone is not a benefit.

The smallest honest footprint is the smallest one that still delivers the declared result, not a direction to minimize visible ambition. “Restrained” describes a deliberate hierarchy and finish; it does not justify default styling or nearly imperceptible effects when the brief calls for a distinctive experience. If a newly added region only advertises its implementation, remove that region and redesign the integration. Shrinking a meaningless effect into a corner does not cure it. This rejects the proposed role, not the required category: actively find a useful role or permitted compatible owner, use only the existing hard-exemption paths, and surface a genuinely unresolved conflict rather than claiming completion. True 3D separately stops when its suitability gate fails.

**Counterexample: a technically real but questionable chart.** An interval strip may use authentic transcript times and a real chart library while separate DOM controls perform all selection. That is real use, not fabricated data, but it does not by itself explain the library's contribution. Ask what the visual lets the user distinguish at its actual size, whether timing/selection is coherent, and which useful rendering or interaction responsibility the owner carries. A compact strip can be appropriate; making it large to advertise the dependency is not the solution. Compare roles and compatible implementations using the existing selection rules. Preserve truthful interval visualization and click-to-seek behavior rather than deleting the capability to reduce dependencies.

Treat cost evidence precisely. An unusually large output chunk warrants checking imports, splitting, and the assigned responsibility. Uncompressed bytes are not measured download, parse, memory, or interaction delay; lazy loading is not proof of zero cost. Use an existing build report or a focused measurement when cost could change the decision, not a new performance campaign for every small component.

**Counterexample: motion present is not a redesign completed.** A brief selection highlight can be excellent feedback; it may be exactly the right motion for a dense workspace. It cannot fix an unreadable primary object or disjointed editing flow. Conversely, do not dismiss quiet feedback and add a dramatic entrance merely to prove GSAP use. Compose motion around the meaningful relationship: selecting a line may update the frame, playhead, range emphasis, and contextual note target while keeping controls stable. Judge that visible result, not the number or duration of tweens. `motion-scroll-and-3d.md` owns implementation, ownership, and reduced-motion rules.

## Worked example: a media review workspace

**Situation.** A user reviews a rough cut, finds a problem through playback or transcript, optionally marks time and image regions, writes a note, saves it, and continues. The same product supports audio-only media. The waveform must reveal pauses and changes in loudness, while the complete video frame must remain readable enough to review subtitles and visual detail.

**Tempting but incomplete fix.** Make a short waveform much taller inside the existing height-limited grid. The waveform now passes a height check, but the video row shrinks; portrait footage fits into a narrow strip, and fewer transcript lines remain visible. In audio mode the old player area becomes a large prompt. Every requested control exists and local interactions pass, yet the task is still awkward. Merely shrinking the waveform back sacrifices the original requirement rather than resolving the competition.

**A coherent design response.**

- Treat frame, transcript position, waveform cursor/range, and note target as views of the same selected media/time state, not independent decorated panels. Store or derive their coordinates consistently.
- Allocate the video-review view using real portrait and landscape material when both are supported. Reduce redundant chrome, move occasional settings out of the primary area, or change the relationship between player, transcript, and timeline when the available height cannot support the old arrangement. Choose among those options from the product's task; this is not a prescribed three-column layout.
- Give audio review its own useful emphasis: listening controls, sufficiently detailed waveform, readable transcript, and reachable notes. Keep a current spoken line if helpful, but do not reserve a large empty video placeholder or design slogan for it.
- Preserve the product's input semantics. In a player where a click seeks and range selection requires an explicit mode, make that mode visible and keep ordinary seeking predictable. Do not copy a demo's drag behavior and silently change the contract.
- Tie a selected transcript line to the matching time and frame. Keep the active line visible without repeatedly overriding a user who is manually browsing. After saving a note, preserve the relevant position and show the saved note or truthful save status in context; do not manufacture persistence.
- Use concise product copy. “Select a time range, then add a note” explains the next action; a large poetic instruction about listening does not replace the working area. A loading label remains truthful while work is pending and should not disguise a stalled state as ready.

**What would count as usability improvement.** At the affected viewport and mode, a reviewer can read the actual frame or transcript, identify a meaningful audio interval, reach the associated note action, and continue after saving without losing position. If a size adjustment improves the waveform but makes subtitles unreadable, the result still fails. These are task-based observations, not universal minimum-pixel rules. They do not establish a successful expressive redesign: when the brief also asks for a striking visual identity and main interaction, judge those against the actual opening, action state, and transition. A readable, synchronized ordinary editor can pass this usability example while failing that design brief. For scoped verification and candidate-versus-normal-entry distinctions, use `visual-qa.md`.

**Limits.** This case does not establish that one library caused slowness, that all workspaces should share this arrangement, or that subtle motion is inadequate. Keep real media safety, input, persistence, and accessibility contracts. It explains a relationship failure, not a reason to rebuild unrelated backend or media-processing code.

## Methods learned from primary design sources

The following sources were reviewed on 2026-09-29. These are bounded design lessons, not a claim of full usability testing or instructions to install the source products' stacks. The explanations here remain usable offline; the links preserve provenance and let an Agent inspect relevant examples when research is needed. They supplement, not replace or expand into another fixed quota beside, the five-source pass in `open-source-ui-sources.md`.

### Linear: quiet structure and stable orientation

[Original design-team explanation](https://linear.app/now/behind-the-latest-design-refresh).

The team describes reducing accumulated visual separators and allowing navigation to recede after the user reaches the working area. Structure remains, but every boundary no longer demands attention. The article was revisited on 2026-10-02: it also separates location/orientation from view controls and keeps equivalent actions predictable across views. Apply this by reducing decorative density without reducing useful information density: subordinate navigation, group related controls, and preserve readable state differences. Do not copy its palette or infer that all separators, labels, colored status marks, or sidebars are bad; the aim is readable priority, not an empty interface. This is the team's explanation and illustrated examples, not a live product trial.

### IBM Carbon: hierarchy within a grid

[Grid usage and contrast examples](https://carbondesignsystem.com/elements/2x-grid/usage/) and [spacing guidance](https://carbondesignsystem.com/elements/spacing/overview/).

Carbon contrasts technically aligned content at similar scales with information grouped into a clearer hierarchy. Its improved example still uses containers: removing boxes alone is not the lesson. Apply alignment and spacing to express relationships, then allocate different prominence to different information. Dense product work can be appropriate. Do not import a fixed column count, spacing token set, or Carbon component system merely because its design explanation is useful.

### Frame.io: several views of the selected object

[Official panel overview](https://help.frame.io/en/articles/9101032-panel-overview).

The documented navigation, viewer, and detail panels let people inspect a selected asset while adjusting visible context and density. The transferable mechanism is retained selection and coordinated views, with supporting regions adaptable to the task. This was documentation evidence, not a logged-in product trial. Do not turn its panel arrangement into the default wireframe for every work surface or assume that resizability excuses a poor initial layout.

### The Pudding: structure follows the explanation

[Original guide to story structure](https://pudding.cool/process/how-to-make-dope-shit-part-3/).

The guide distinguishes stacked explanations, a visual that evolves through scrolling, and step-based progression; it does not present one universal template. Apply that choice to what a reader needs to understand: a complex relationship may benefit from seeing the same object change rather than repeatedly reorienting to new charts. Do not force pinned scrolling into ordinary tools, obscure essential information before an animation, or forget reverse navigation and reduced motion.

### Stripe Press: the subject becomes the composition

[The original designer's account of the 2021 project](https://yuinchien.com/p/stripe-press).

The designer describes translating the physical qualities of books into a digital presentation of their spines and covers. The lesson is to let the actual product shape the experience rather than append an unrelated effect to a generic layout. This is a historical design case, not a verified current interaction test. It does not make 3D mandatory: UI Done's spatial suitability and finish-quality gates still apply, and source images/code require their own permission before reuse.
